	This is the first journal entry of this project. Today, I'm going to figure out what kind I need from SQL in order to 
	complete the database portion of the chatroom.
	Conclusion: I made a folder in the www directory of wampserver. Will need to relearn how to use wampserver and php.

	Goal: Relearn how to use wampserver and php in order to do the project. Will look through past projects on wampserver to help.
	Update 1: No longer using Javascript for the chatroom. We'll be using Java and Vaadin for the chatroom. The project is also too simple
			  so we'll be implementing voice chat and other features as well. 
		  Victor gave us a series of videos to watch that directly involve the project that we're going to be doing.
		  I'll be watching these videos over the weekend and we will discuss as a group what to do when we come back on Monday.
		  We are no longer using things like wampserver and php, and etc. We'll be using strictly Java.
		  My goal for Monday is to be ready and know exactly what we need and what to do for the project.

	Over the weekend I watched the videos. I understood the general idea and what components are needed for the chatroom. I will have
	to look over the specifics though as we didn't learn some of the stuff in class. This class period, I will be looking into voice 
	chat and ways to implement that into the chatroom. Our project also revolves around basically one computer communicating with another
	so two classes will have to be made with different code. It seems that the majority of this week's class time will be devoted to 
	learning and understanding parts we need to have our classes come together and work properly.
	Conclusion: More research required.

	Finishing up the videos. Starting to understand more about what is needed for the project and how the server-side code is going 
	to interact with the client-side code. 
	Goal: Finish up all the videos and fully understand everything. I'm implementing emojis into the chatroom so I will also need
		  to start research on how to detect and change character inputs when it detects characters that could make an emoji.

May 12, 2017
	Starting research on how to import images into the chatroom and I'll be working with Mahin on that because he is importing
	pure images and I'm importing tinier images for the emojis. 

May 16, 2017
	I'm going to be importing an emoji library and using they're unicodes and String characters to detect them in order
	for it to change dynamically in the text area.

May 17, 2017
	Downloaded jar files for the emoji library and will import the libraries into the project. Also started making methods
	for checking and changing characters in the string message into emojis.
	
May 22, 2017
	Added emoji jar files into a new folder in the SymposuiumServerSide and SymnposiumClientSide projects.
	I'm going to test the methods out and see if it works and how I can implement it into our current code. If it works I'll 
	start implementing them into the methods I am creating.
