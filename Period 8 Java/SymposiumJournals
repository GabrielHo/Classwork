	This is the first journal entry of this project. Today, I'm going to figure out what kind I need from SQL in order to 
	complete the database portion of the chatroom.
	Conclusion: I made a folder in the www directory of wampserver. Will need to relearn how to use wampserver and php.

	Goal: Relearn how to use wampserver and php in order to do the project. Will look through past projects on wampserver to help.
	Update 1: No longer using Javascript for the chatroom. We'll be using Java and Vaadin for the chatroom. The project is also too simple
			  so we'll be implementing voice chat and other features as well. 
		  Victor gave us a series of videos to watch that directly involve the project that we're going to be doing.
		  I'll be watching these videos over the weekend and we will discuss as a group what to do when we come back on Monday.
		  My goal for Monday is to be ready and know exactly what we need and what to do for the project.
